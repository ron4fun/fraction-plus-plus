## Fraction++


It is a C++ Implementation of fraction class like the one in python and with added features.


Example
---------



    
    #include <iostream>
    using namespace std;
     
	#include "fraction.h"

    int main()
	{
	    fraction f(1,5);
	    fraction f2 = f.inverse();
	    fraction f3 = f * 6;
	    fraction f4(23, 57);
	    fraction f5 = f;
	    const fraction f6(4,8);
	    fraction f7(-28);
	    fraction f8(0);
	
	    cout << f << " + " << f2 << " = " << f+f2 << endl;
	    cout << f << " * " << 6 << " = " << f3 << endl;
	    cout << "(" << f4 << ")^5 = " << f4.pow(5) << endl;
	    cout << f5 << " > " << f2 << " : " << (f5 > f2) << endl;
	    cout << f4 << " -= 1 : ";
	    f4 -= 1;
	    cout << f4 << endl;
	    cout << "(" << f << ")++  : ";
	    ++f;
	    cout << f << endl;
	    cout << f5 << " * " << f4 << " = " << f5*f4 << endl;
	    cout << "(" << f6 << ")^3 = " << f6.pow(3) << endl;
	
	    cout << "f7.inverse() = " << f7.inverse() << endl;
	    cout << "f8 = " << f8 << endl;
	    cout << "f6 = " << f6 << endl << "f6.inverse() = " << f6.inverse() << endl;
	
	    return 0;
	} // end func main

Note
------

	The fraction class is purposefully made to be within the <int> range and if 
	need be it can be extended to support big integer values.
